We were to create either a drone detection software, or a manufacturing default recognition system, and we chose the drone detection software. We created a system that uses machine learning to detect drones as well as their estimated type, distance and size. In order to do this we needed to create a stereo camera system, in which I designed and 3D printed the casing in Fusion 360 to assure that the cameras were at the correct distance and could be adapted to a real world setting. I also designed the front end of the website, shown here, that displays the data detected during each recording or submitted photo to the program.')">

The zipties were suprisingly functional. The second bot is called Slither.io, and I built it on my own, as my first bot with a weapon. I though the mismatched eyes were funny at the time but if I were to print it again I would use the aligned version of the lid. Also the laser jet stopped early. The last is the most recent one that I also designed by myself, and it is modelled after a lawn mower. I actually won all but one of my matchups in this competition, and beat the front runner because his battery caught fire. All of these were modelled by me in Fusion 360 or Solidworks, at then were 3D printed, resin printed, or cut with a lasercutter or waterjet. Then I configured and soldered the electronics and assembled everything. They were not programmed because we manually competed with them.')">
